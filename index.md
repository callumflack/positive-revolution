  copy1: 'Leaders who understand the importance of organisational culture and have
    taken the opportunity to focus energy, time and resources have found major improvements
    in profits, productivity, recruiting, morale, motivation, customer service, leadership
    and retention, just to mention a few.

'
  copy2: "## So what is culture?\n\nCulture is the personality of an organisation.
    This is displayed through the values, beliefs and standards to which a company
    works. To really understand the culture of an organisation, look directly at the
    people who work within it.\n\nAs the personality guides what a person does, so
    the culture of an organisation is guided by what their people do. This could be
    their attitudes, level of service to others, drivers and motivations, problem
    solving abilities, and their capacity to think outside the square and innovate.\n\nThe
    culture of an organisation will determine the level of active engagement of the
    employees within the organisation. All culture is driven by the leaders. \n\nBad
    culture is usually indicated by high absenteeism, low morale and limited productivity.\n\nCreating
    and maintaining the desired culture can be hard to do, though with the assistance
    of trained professionals, persistent effort and commitment to the team, leaders
    can make any workplace an enjoyable experience for all.\n\nSo what kind of a culture
    does your organisation want?\n\n## What we offer\n\nPositive Revolution offers
    a range of varied programs and opportunities from:\n\n* Leadership and executive
    coaching\n* Team building days (indoor and out, half or full days)\n* Leadership
    and communication trainnings\n* Strategic planning meetings\n* Innovation planning
    days\n* Succession planning programs\n* Professional development programs for
    leaders\n* Gap analysis and productivity planning\n* Change management processes\n*
    And more…\n"
