    ## So what is culture?

    Culture is the personality of an organisation. This is displayed through the values, beliefs and standards to which a company works. To really understand the culture of an organisation, look directly at the people who work within it.

    As the personality guides what a person does, so the culture of an organisation is guided by what their people do. This could be their attitudes, level of service to others, drivers and motivations, problem solving abilities, and their capacity to think outside the square and innovate.

    The culture of an organisation will determine the level of active engagement of the employees within the organisation. All culture is driven by the leaders. Bad culture is usually indicated by high absenteeism, low morale and limited productivity.

    Creating and maintaining the desired culture can be hard to do, though with the assistance of trained professionals, persistent effort and commitment to the team, leaders can make any workplace an enjoyable experience for all.

    So what kind of a culture does your organisation want?
