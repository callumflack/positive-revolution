                    <p>Leaders who understand the importance of organisational culture and have taken the opportunity to focus energy, time and resources have found major improvements in profits, productivity, recruiting, morale, motivation, customer service, leadership and retention, just to mention a few.</p>

                    <h2 id="so-what-is-culture">So what is culture?</h2>

<p>Culture is the personality of an organisation. This is displayed through the values, beliefs and standards to which a company works. To really understand the culture of an organisation, look directly at the people who work within it.</p>

<p>As the personality guides what a person does, so the culture of an organisation is guided by what their people do. This could be their attitudes, level of service to others, drivers and motivations, problem solving abilities, and their capacity to think outside the square and innovate.</p>

<p>The culture of an organisation will determine the level of active engagement of the employees within the organisation. All culture is driven by the leaders.</p>

<p>Bad culture is usually indicated by high absenteeism, low morale and limited productivity.</p>

<p>Creating and maintaining the desired culture can be hard to do, though with the assistance of trained professionals, persistent effort and commitment to the team, leaders can make any workplace an enjoyable experience for all.</p>

<p>So what kind of a culture does your organisation want?</p>

                        “I recently had the pleasure of utilising the professional services of Greg Smedts from Positive Revolution.  I decided to put my experience into words to assist other potential clients considering engaging Greg.

Greg has some of the most important assets of a coach and trainer in that he LISTENS - LEARNS - INFORMS - FOLLOWS UP.  Greg does not pretend to know it all and stick to a rigid text.  He has the ability to gather the information and in most cases the answers from the client themselves.  Greg then relays back to the client simple but forthright strategies that are more than achievable.

Over the many years I have been in business I have meet them all, “Business”/ “Life” coaches, some have been very good in what they offer but unfortunately most of them were a waste of time.  Greg falls into the very good in my humble opinion and in this regard I would highly recommend his services to anyone considering a positive outcome.  I will be engaging Greg again in the near future for further assistance relating to other business matters.”
