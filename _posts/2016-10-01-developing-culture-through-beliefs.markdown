In the last blog post we discussed vision, mission and values to ensure you began designing the kind of culture you want to have in your organisation. Every step of this process is as important as the last. We will be required to ensure we have ongoing development in all areas, because things do change on a continuous basis. The only thing you can be certain about in this world is that it will constantly change. Just when you think you have it figured out, it will change again.

In this post we are going to take a look at the beliefs within the organisation and how it contributes to the culture.

Firstly:

•   What do you believe about the work you do?

•   Is it a waste of time, because it really isn’t that important?

•   Do you believe that people won’t change, so what is the point?

•   Do you believe that everyone is open to learn new experiences given the time and right incentives?

To start off with I want to ask you what you think a belief is?

The popular definition of a belief is it’s a “Convenient assumption about the way the world is.”

So if a belief is just a convenient assumption, then how easy would it be to change our beliefs!  Think of a belief as a tall sky scraper (because it has taken many years to build your beliefs), and the foundations of it are the reasons we have to put in place to hold the belief to be true (Some of the foundations are deep because you have spent years developing reasons for the beliefs to be true).  What happens when we begin to question the reasons of a particular belief and figure out the reasons really can’t support that belief any longer?  Then your sky scraper begins to sway and shake, and eventually it will come down because without reasons your beliefs can’t stand.

Now the test is making up a new beliefs and installing them, because if you take something away you must replace it with another or the same belief will be pulled back in to fill the void.

It is up to the leaders in the organisation to assist the staff with changing their beliefs for the benefit of the organisation.  As an example, it is helpful to change the beliefs of salespeople who has limiting beliefs around how much money they can make.  It is also about assisting admin staff to believe that being able to communicate the needs of the staff to upper management so things can get better.  A great belief in this instance for an organisation would be open communication is the key to success.  It would really change the way everyone in the company communicated.
