Rehashing these at times is good for every business owner from macro business to medium business owners, even perhaps big business as well.  After having a conversation with a business associate recently it became aware that some business professionals are still unaware of these points.  This prompted me to again hit the refresh button on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order these are Mindset, Motivation, Match, and Media/Market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindset&lt;/strong&gt; – When working with clients I often find myself asking about their mindset for business.  I ask them if they see their business in their mind in 10 years’ time.  If this is not something you can visualise then I am concerned they don’t have the determination and persistence to make the sacrifices needed to ensure the longevity of the business.  I begin by getting the business professionals to ensure they are in the right industry and when I say this, I mean do they have the passion for what they are doing or is it a means to get money to fund a lifestyle they believe they want.  If the first is not the case, then I recommend they find something more aligned with their passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivation&lt;/strong&gt; – Ask yourself if you’re in business, are you motivated every day to want to get up and do what you do.  I know that not everyone every day is bursting out of their skin to bounce out of bed and begin the grey matter swirling with possibilities of what they can do next to provide even more value to their customers and clients.  We all have our ups and downs and anyone who tells you different is a liar.  You want to wake up every day with a though of how can I be of better service today.  Be it by changing a way you serve your customers or a change in product which will provide even more benefit to your clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Match&lt;/strong&gt; – This is an important one because not everyone is going to want what you provide.  The idea is to work out who is going to be your match.  Why do you do what you do?  Like Simon Sinek has written about “Start with Why” then go and find the people who are a match and believe what you believe about your product or service.  Don’t try to be a match for everyone because you will waste valuable time and resources chopping and changing to be someone you aren’t to please people who don’t believe what you believe.  Dig deep and really think about who would be the best match for you and then go and complete the last M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media/Market&lt;/strong&gt; – Now you are determined you are in the right business and are dedicated to being in it for the long run.  You wake up majority of the time excited by the possibility of being able to better serve the people who are your clients and are working out how to do it even better.  You know what your match is and you are focused on targeting them because they are looking for the solution you provide.  Finally, how are you going to reach them?  Is it through the TV, Radio, newspaper, online blogging, viral videos or even holding demonstrations or speaking engagements.  Remember though which ever method you choose make sure you test and measure.  This way, in time you will find out what is working and what is not working for you.  When you know, what is working for you, focus your energy and resources there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you know the 4 M’s of business if you didn’t know them before or have just had a refresher.  Action is the key to any type of success so plan, execute and reap the rewards, though always remember you will have ups and you will have downs.\
Stay strong in the downs and don’t let the ups go to your head!&lt;/p&gt;

(Jack Stack certainly thinks so!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should it be considered as one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you ever hear business professional using terms like “having a win”, “made a bad play” or even “dropped the ball” etc. Certainly sounds like a game to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do you get to know how to play a game?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you learn the rules, don’t you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many business owners who are currently running businesses without knowing how to play the game by the rules. How do I know! By having conversations with business owners weekly in regards to how successful their businesses are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I keep finding is they’re not playing by the rules to become successful. They’re playing by some, if not most of the rules, though they don’t have all the rules to ensure they are successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so how do you become successful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first point in any game is to decide how you will measure success, as success is different for every person. So firstly what is your version of success for now in your profession. I say for now because as you achieve success, your version of success will also change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you know what success is for you, you then need to be brutally honest with yourself and work out where you are currently in comparison to your successful state. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t start playing the game until you figure this out in detail!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing where you are and where you want to be are the makings for your success. The next rule of the game is doing a gap analysis of what you have in place, what you need to have in place and what is in place that shouldn’t even be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of the end result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you do for your customers and clients?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the KIS model {Keep It Simple} breakdown the fundamentals for your business. At the core, what is it you do for your customers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance – if you provide an end product which you build. E.g. Shed, house, Boat, caravan etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You take manufactured materials and use them by shaping, bending and joining for the end result. So the job is to provide great service, in a timely manner of the highest quality which you and your team can produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you currently providing the highest quality product with the best customer service? If not, then the question is, what’s missing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember: &lt;strong&gt;The GAME never ends!&lt;/strong&gt; Just when you think you have it all figured out and you’re doing everything right, something will change which will have you going over your processes again. The businesses who don’t continuously develop and change are no longer around. (Take Blockbuster for instance.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Ensure you continue on an ongoing cycle of learning and business development to stay on the crest of the success wave.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Is this true?

Every step of this process is as important as the last. We will be required to ensure we have ongoing development in all areas, because things do change on a continuous basis. The only thing you can be certain about in this world is that it will constantly change. Just when you think you have it figured out, it will change again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we are going to take a look at the beliefs within the organisation and how it contributes to the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•   What do you believe about the work you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•   Is it a waste of time, because it really isn’t that important?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•   Do you believe that people won’t change, so what is the point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•   Do you believe that everyone is open to learn new experiences given the time and right incentives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start off with I want to ask you what you think a belief is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popular definition of a belief is it’s a “Convenient assumption about the way the world is.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if a belief is just a convenient assumption, then how easy would it be to change our beliefs!  Think of a belief as a tall sky scraper (because it has taken many years to build your beliefs), and the foundations of it are the reasons we have to put in place to hold the belief to be true (Some of the foundations are deep because you have spent years developing reasons for the beliefs to be true).  What happens when we begin to question the reasons of a particular belief and figure out the reasons really can’t support that belief any longer?  Then your sky scraper begins to sway and shake, and eventually it will come down because without reasons your beliefs can’t stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the test is making up a new beliefs and installing them, because if you take something away you must replace it with another or the same belief will be pulled back in to fill the void.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is up to the leaders in the organisation to assist the staff with changing their beliefs for the benefit of the organisation.  As an example, it is helpful to change the beliefs of salespeople who has limiting beliefs around how much money they can make.  It is also about assisting admin staff to believe that being able to communicate the needs of the staff to upper management so things can get better.  A great belief in this instance for an organisation would be open communication is the key to success.  It would really change the way everyone in the company communicated.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">In the last blog post we discussed vision, mission and values to ensure you began designing the kind of culture you want to have in your organisation.
